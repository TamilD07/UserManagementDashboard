# User Management System

This is a full-stack user management application developed using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The project showcases a responsive frontend, reusable components, secure APIs, and a connected MongoDB database.

## Features

- **Frontend**: React SPA with Redux, reusable components, form validation, and routing.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express RESTful API with JWT-based authentication.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user information.
- **Unit Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for critical component testing.
- **Performance**: Optimized with lazy loading and memoization.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v16 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Running locally)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/user-management-system.git
   cd user-management-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. Configure MongoDB:
   - Start MongoDB locally by running:
     ```bash
     mongod
     ```
   - Update `backend/.env` with the local MongoDB connection string:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/user_management
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     ```

4. Seed the database (optional):
   ```bash
   node backend/seed.js
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open the application in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
